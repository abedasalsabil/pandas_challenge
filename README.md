# pandas_challenge
Hello, my name is Abeda Salsabil
This is my pandas assignment.
This assignment was a bit harder than I thought, but I was able to pull through in the end.
I would like to thank all the Learning Assistants who have helped answer my questions regarding this assignment!
It was very fun analyzing the data and making conclusions at the end. 

My assignment is the file named Module_4_challenge.ipynb.

Thank you and happy coding!
